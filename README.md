**Introduction to Spring Boot**

Through this series of exercises, a practical understanding of creating microservices with Spring Boot has been achieved.

REST API Fundamentals: Two basic APIs were built to understand how endpoints work, handling HTTP GET requests and processing data through both query parameters (@RequestParam) and path variables (@PathVariable).

Dependency Management: Two of the most widely used dependency managers in the Java ecosystem, Maven and Gradle, were explored and compared. This allowed for familiarization with their project structures and command-line tools for compiling, packaging, and running applications.

Development Tools: Essential tools for the modern workflow were utilized. Development environments were set up in Eclipse, and Postman was used to professionally test the APIs by creating environments and variables to efficiently manage test configurations.
